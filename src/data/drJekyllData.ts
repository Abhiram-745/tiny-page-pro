    quote: "Man is not truly one, but truly two.",
    themes: "Duality, Good vs Evil, Identity, Science & Transgression",
    ao2: `Stevenson uses antithesis ("not truly one, but truly two") to show that humans are made of two opposite sides — good and evil.

The structure of the sentence mirrors this idea, as it is neatly divided into two balanced parts, just like Jekyll's own divided self.

The repetition of "truly" adds force and makes Jekyll sound confident and scientific, as if this is a proven fact.

The word "Man" is general, showing that Jekyll's discovery applies to everyone, not just himself.

Effect: Makes the reader see Jekyll's problem as a reflection of all human nature, not a single man's madness.`,
    ao3: `Victorians often hid their immoral desires behind a respectable image, just as Jekyll hides Hyde.

Links to Freud's later idea that people have two sides — the civilised self and the hidden desires.`,

    title: '"I concealed my pleasures."',
    quote: "I concealed my pleasures.",
    themes: "Repression, Secrecy, Hypocrisy, Sin",
    ao2: `The verb "concealed" shows deliberate hiding — Jekyll chooses to hide what he enjoys because he fears society's judgement.

The noun "pleasures" is a euphemism (a polite word) that hides what kind of pleasures he means — possibly sinful or secret acts.

The short, simple sentence mirrors Jekyll's restraint — it feels tight and controlled, like he is holding something back.

The tone is cold and factual, which makes the act of hiding seem normal, showing how used he is to repression.

Effect: Stevenson suggests that hiding human desires doesn't remove them — it only forces them to grow stronger in secret.`,
    ao3: `In Victorian society, pleasure and passion were considered sinful.

People were expected to appear moral, so repression became a way of survival. Jekyll's secret side reflects this social hypocrisy.`,

    title: '"My devil had been long caged, he came out roaring."',
    quote: "My devil had been long caged, he came out roaring.",
    themes: "Repression, Duality, Evil, Religion",
    ao2: `The metaphor "my devil" turns Hyde into a symbol of Jekyll's inner sin and temptation.

The possessive "my" shows ownership — the evil comes from within Jekyll, not from outside.

The imagery of imprisonment ("long caged") shows how Jekyll tried to keep his darker side locked away, but this only builds pressure.

The verb "roaring" sounds wild and animal-like, showing complete loss of control and human reason.

The sudden change of tense from "had been" to "came" makes the release feel fast and violent.

Effect: Repression builds up power like a cage holding back an animal; when released, evil bursts out uncontrollably.`,
    ao3: `Links to Christian ideas of the devil and sin — Hyde represents temptation.

Also fits with early psychology: repressing instincts too much can cause them to return even stronger (a key Freudian idea).`,

    title: '"Trampled calmly."',
    quote: "Trampled calmly.",
    themes: "Violence, Repression, Evil, Society's Hypocrisy",
    ao2: `The phrase is an oxymoron because it mixes a violent action ("trampled") with a peaceful one ("calmly"). This shocks the reader.

The verb "trampled" suggests destruction and cruelty, while "calmly" makes it worse by showing how emotionless Hyde is.

The contrast in sound — hard 't' and soft 'l' — makes the phrase unsettling, as if the violence feels unnaturally quiet.

Effect: Stevenson makes Hyde's cruelty seem casual and controlled, showing how evil can exist even in calmness.`,
    ao3: `This reflects Victorian fears that beneath civilisation and manners, humans still had savage instincts.

Influenced by Darwin's idea that humans were linked to animals and could "devolve" back into brutality.`,

    title: '"The moment I choose, I can be rid of Mr Hyde."',
    quote: "The moment I choose, I can be rid of Mr Hyde.",
    themes: "Science & Transgression, Duality, Repression, Pride",
    ao2: `The modal verb "can" and the phrase "I choose" show overconfidence — Jekyll believes he has full control over his darker side.

The short declarative sentence sounds calm and firm, which creates dramatic irony, because readers know he will later lose control completely.

The tone is certain and logical, showing Jekyll's pride and belief that science can solve moral problems.

Effect: Stevenson uses this confident statement to warn against arrogance — Jekyll's illusion of control will lead to his destruction.`,
    ao3: `Reflects the Victorian belief in science and progress — but also the fear that humans were "playing God."

Like Frankenstein, it criticises the idea that science can separate good and evil or control human nature.`,

    quote: "Unscientific balderdash.",
    themes: "Science vs Religion, Repression (of curiosity), Rationalism",
    ao2: `Diction "balderdash" is dismissive, emotional, and harsh — plosive-heavy sounds express anger.

Adjective "unscientific" shows how science itself becomes moral code — ironic rigidity.

Tone: derisive; speech exposes emotional bias behind rational façade.

Effect: Shows limits of reason — rational repression of imaginative inquiry.`,

    quote: "The drug shook the very fortress of identity.",
    themes: "Science, Duality, Transformation, Transgression",
    ao2: `Metaphor "fortress of identity" presents the self as strong yet vulnerable to internal assault.

Dynamic verb "shook" = violence to the psyche; sense of invasion.

Alliteration ("fortress of") adds solidity that contrasts with shaking — rhythm embodies instability.

Effect: Science destabilises moral identity; physical change mirrors psychological fragmentation.`,

    themes: "Religion, Fear, Science vs Faith, Madness",
    ao2: `Repetition of divine name shows desperation and return to faith.

Broken syntax / exclamatory punctuation convey mental collapse.

Sound ("O") gives wailing rhythm — primitive and prayer-like.

Effect: Rational control collapses into instinctive belief; religion re-emerges under terror.`,

    ao2: `Simile / zoomorphism links Hyde to primitive animal instinct.

Plosives create violence in sound; phrase has percussive rhythm like beating.

Abstract noun "fury" = loss of rationality; unrestrained passion.

Effect: Presents Hyde as de-evolved — physical embodiment of repressed primal self.`,

    themes: "Evil, Religion, Appearance vs Reality, Identity",
    ao2: `Metaphor / religious diction: evil physically marked like handwriting — identity written by sin.

Sibilance ("Satan's signature") creates sinister hiss.

Alliteration draws attention to moral branding.

Effect: Suggests visible corruption — evil cannot be hidden.`,

    ao2: `Grotesque imagery: "blisters" and "distained" imply disease and neglect.

Alliteration (b/d) roughens sound; creates visual ugliness.

Symbolism: door as threshold between respectable world and hidden sin.

Effect: Physical decay mirrors moral corruption — setting becomes character's conscience.`,

    ao2: `Personification: fog appears alive yet dormant, symbolising moral blindness.

Metaphor "drowned city": evokes suffocation, corruption engulfing civilisation.

Sibilance ("slept…wing") produces softness and eeriness — concealment through sound.

Effect: Creates oppressive atmosphere of secrecy and decay; reflects moral uncertainty.`,

    themes: "Repression, Setting, Secrecy, Isolation",
    ao2: `Imagery: "dusty" = neglect, secrecy; "barred" = imprisonment.

Triadic structure ("three…windows…iron") gives heavy rhythm, reinforcing confinement.

Harsh consonants mirror rigidity and suppression.

Effect: Symbolises emotional imprisonment and moral decay; light (truth) excluded.`,

    ao2: `Repetition of "wrong" emphasises moral condemnation — rhythm mimics gossip and rejection.

Euphemism "go wrong" conceals what is meant — language itself represses truth.

Tone: conversational and judgemental, not analytical.

Effect: Reveals how polite society labels unorthodox thinking as insanity; fear of deviation.`,

    themes: "Duality, Transformation, Evil, Identity",
    ao2: `Violent verb "struck out" suggests sudden erasure; civility destroyed in an instant.

Juxtaposition of "smile" with "terror and despair" symbolises moral inversion.

Adjective "abject" heightens total hopelessness — loss of humanity.

Sentence rhythm moves smoothly from calm to chaos, mirroring transformation.

Effect: Captures collapse of mask and revelation of inner horror — duality violently exposed.`,
