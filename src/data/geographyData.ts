    content: `📚 Definition:
An ecosystem is a community of living organisms (plants, animals, microorganisms) interacting with the non-living environment (climate, soil, water, light).

🌿 Structure of an Ecosystem:
• Producers – Plants that make energy through photosynthesis (e.g. trees, shrubs, algae).
• Consumers – Animals that eat plants or other animals (e.g. monkeys, birds, snakes).
• Decomposers – Fungi, bacteria that break down dead organisms, returning nutrients to the soil.
• Each part is interdependent — if one is removed (e.g. trees), the whole system is disrupted.

🌍 Benefits of Ecosystems:
• Biodiversity: Rainforests support over 50% of global species.
• Climate regulation: Trees absorb CO₂ and release oxygen.
• Water cycle: Transpiration from leaves maintains rainfall patterns.
• Soil protection: Roots prevent erosion.
• Resources: Food, timber, and medicines used worldwide.`,

    title: "Food Chains and Food Webs",
    topic: "The Living World - Tropical Rainforests",
    content: `🌱 Food Chain Example (Amazon):
Oak Tree → Caterpillar → Bird → Snake → Jaguar

Each stage is called a trophic level:
• Producers: Make food from sunlight.
• Primary consumers: Eat producers (herbivores).
• Secondary consumers: Eat primary consumers.
• Tertiary consumers: Top predators.

🕸️ Food Webs:
A food web is a complex network of interconnected food chains showing how energy flows through an ecosystem.

In the Amazon rainforest, energy flows between:
• Producers: Trees, vines, grasses.
• Consumers: Insects, monkeys, frogs, jaguars.
• Decomposers: Fungi, bacteria, termites.

If a species is removed, it affects all others — e.g. fewer insects mean less food for birds and reptiles.

⚖️ Differences:
• Food Chain: Simple, one line of energy transfer, easily disrupted
• Food Web: Complex, many connections, more stable and balanced`,
    keyPoints: [
      "Food chains show linear energy transfer through trophic levels",
      "Food webs show complex interconnected relationships",
      "Producers → Primary → Secondary → Tertiary consumers",

    title: "Nutrient Cycle (Gersmehl Model)",
    topic: "The Living World - Tropical Rainforests",
    content: `🌱 Explanation:
The nutrient cycle shows how nutrients move between biomass (B), litter (Li), and soil (S).

Gersmehl Model for Tropical Rainforest:
   (B) Biomass  – Large store
      ↑ U (Uptake)
      ↓ F (Fall of litter)
   (Li) Litter  – Small store
      ↓ D (Decomposition)
      ↓ R (Runoff loss)
   (S) Soil  – Small store
      ↑ W (Weathering input)
      ↓ Le (Leaching loss)

🌳 In the TRF:
• Biomass is large (most nutrients in vegetation).
• Decomposition is fast due to warm, moist climate.
• Nutrients quickly taken up by plants — thin soils.
• Heavy rainfall causes leaching (nutrients washed away).

⚠️ When Biomass Is Removed (Deforestation):
• Fewer leaves fall → less litter → fewer nutrients returned to soil.
• Nutrient cycle slows down or collapses.
• Rain washes nutrients away → infertile soil → desert-like conditions.`,
    keyPoints: [
      "Nutrients cycle between biomass, litter, and soil",
      "TRF has large biomass store but small soil store",
      "Fast decomposition due to warm, moist climate",
      "Leaching removes nutrients from thin soils",
      "Deforestation disrupts the entire nutrient cycle"

    title: "Characteristics of Tropical Rainforests",
    topic: "The Living World - Tropical Rainforests",
    content: `📍 Location:
Found around the Equator (0°) – e.g. Amazon Basin (South America), Congo Basin (Africa), Southeast Asia.

🌡️ Climate:
• Temperature: Constantly high, about 26–28°C all year
• Rainfall: Very high, about 2000–2500 mm per year
• Seasons: No real seasons – hot and wet all year
• Humidity: Around 80% average

🌳 Vegetation Structure:
• Emergent layer (40–60m): Tallest trees, exposed to sunlight, e.g. Kapok tree
• Canopy (25–40m): Dense layer blocks sunlight, home to most wildlife
• Understorey (10–25m): Limited light, small trees and ferns
• Forest floor (0–10m): Dark, damp, decomposing matter and roots

🪴 Plant Adaptations:
• Drip-tip leaves – allow rain to run off quickly, preventing rot.
• Buttress roots – large roots support tall trees in shallow soil.
• Lianas and vines – climb trees to reach sunlight.
• Epiphytes – grow on other plants to access sunlight.
• Thin bark – no need for protection from cold or fires.

🐍 Animal Adaptations:
• Camouflage – e.g. tree frogs blend with leaves.
• Prehensile tails – monkeys swing between trees.
• Bright colours / calls – for mating or warnings.
• Slow movement – sloths conserve energy in dense canopy.`,
    keyPoints: [
      "Located around the Equator with 26-28°C temperatures year-round",
      "High rainfall (2000-2500mm) with no distinct seasons",
      "Four distinct vegetation layers: emergent, canopy, understorey, forest floor",
      "Plants adapted with drip-tips, buttress roots, and thin bark",
      "Animals show camouflage, prehensile tails, and energy conservation"

    title: "Deforestation in the Amazon Basin",
    topic: "The Living World - Tropical Rainforests",
    content: `🔹 Main Causes:
• Logging: Valuable hardwoods (mahogany, teak) cut for export.
• Farming (Cattle Ranching): 80% of deforestation – clearing for beef production.
• Commercial Crops: Soya, palm oil, sugar cane plantations.
• Mining: Gold, iron ore, and bauxite extraction.
• HEP Dams: Flood vast areas for electricity.
• Road Building: e.g. Trans-Amazonian Highway allows access to remote areas.
• Settlement: New towns and farming communities expand.

🔹 Consequences:
• Climate Change: Fewer trees → less CO₂ absorbed → global warming.
• Biodiversity Loss: Species extinction – habitats destroyed.
• Soil Erosion: Roots gone → heavy rain washes soil away.
• Water Cycle Disruption: Less transpiration → reduced rainfall → drought.
• Indigenous Displacement: Tribes lose homes and culture.
• Economic Gain (Short-term): Jobs, exports, income – but unsustainable long-term.`,
